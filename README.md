# EpidemySimulator

A simple epidemy simulator (which should not really be taken seriously)

I created this program in 2020 when I heard about Covid.

It uses a C# SFML package for graphics and a GUI library I created.

The principle is trivial, each infected agent has a given probability to contaminate its neighbours in a given radius. They will then become immune and can lost their immunity with a given probability.

I should probably rewrite this better when I have time.
